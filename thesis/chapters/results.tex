\section{Testing Setup}
A controlled testing environment using virtual machines running Windows and Linux was set up to evaluate implant functionality.

\section{Results}
The system successfully demonstrated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time command execution across multiple implants.
    \item Secure communication between the server and implants.
    \item Effective bypassing of basic antivirus mechanisms in controlled environments.
\end{itemize}
