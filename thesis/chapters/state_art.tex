\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:sota_introduction}

The evolution of Command and Control (C2) frameworks represents a critical domain within cybersecurity research, encompassing both offensive security tools and defensive analysis capabilities. This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of the art in C2 framework development, examining existing solutions, their architectural approaches, and their contributions to the cybersecurity research community.

The systematic review presented herein serves multiple purposes: first, to establish the theoretical and practical foundation upon which this research builds; second, to identify gaps and limitations in existing solutions that justify the development of a novel framework; and third, to position the contributions of this thesis within the broader context of cybersecurity research and tool development.

Contemporary C2 frameworks can be categorized into three primary classifications: commercial solutions designed for professional penetration testing and red team operations, open-source frameworks developed by the security research community, and academic prototypes created for educational and research purposes. Each category exhibits distinct characteristics in terms of functionality, accessibility, documentation quality, and intended use cases.

\section{Taxonomy of Command and Control Frameworks}
\label{sec:c2_taxonomy}

\subsection{Commercial C2 Solutions}
\label{subsec:commercial_solutions}

Commercial Command and Control frameworks represent the most mature and feature-complete solutions available in the cybersecurity market. These platforms typically offer comprehensive post-exploitation capabilities, sophisticated evasion techniques, and professional support structures.

\subsubsection{Cobalt Strike}

\textbf{Cobalt Strike}, developed by Strategic Cyber LLC, stands as the de facto standard for commercial C2 operations \cite{mudge2012cobalt}. The framework employs a client-server architecture where operators connect to a team server that manages implant communications. Key architectural features include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Beacon Technology}: Utilizes HTTP/HTTPS beaconing with jitter and sleep intervals to evade network detection
\item \textbf{Malleable Profiles}: Customizable communication profiles that modify network traffic characteristics
\item \textbf{Lateral Movement}: Built-in capabilities for privilege escalation and network traversal
\item \textbf{Evasion Techniques}: Advanced anti-forensic and anti-analysis features
\end{itemize}

The framework's strength lies in its mature feature set and extensive documentation. However, its commercial licensing model (approximately \$3,500 per user annually) creates significant barriers for academic institutions and independent researchers \cite{rapid7_2023_cs}.

Metasploit Pro

The commercial variant of the Metasploit Framework extends the open-source foundation with enterprise-grade features including automated exploitation, advanced reporting, and team collaboration capabilities \cite{kennedy2011metasploit}. While primarily focused on vulnerability exploitation rather than C2 operations, its post-exploitation modules provide valuable insights into implant management architectures.

\subsection{Open-Source C2 Frameworks}
\label{subsec:opensource_solutions}

The open-source community has developed numerous C2 frameworks that address the accessibility limitations of commercial solutions while providing transparency for research applications.

\subsubsection{Sliver}

Sliver, developed by Bishop Fox, represents a modern approach to open-source C2 development \cite{bishopfox2022sliver}. Written in Go, the framework emphasizes cross-platform compatibility and operational security:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Multi-Platform Support}: Native implants for Windows, macOS, and Linux
\item \textbf{Multiple Protocols}: HTTP(S), DNS, and TCP communication channels
\item \textbf{Multiplayer Support}: Team server architecture supporting multiple operators
\item \textbf{Modern Architecture}: Utilizes gRPC for client-server communication
\end{itemize}

The framework's adoption of modern software engineering practices, including continuous integration and comprehensive testing, sets a high standard for open-source C2 development.

\subsubsection{Covenant}

Covenant, developed by Cobbr, implements a C2 framework using Microsoft's .NET ecosystem \cite{cobbr2019covenant}. The framework's architecture demonstrates several innovative approaches:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Role-Based Access Control}: Multi-user support with granular permissions
\item \textbf{Docker Deployment}: Containerized deployment for simplified setup
\end{itemize}

Covenant's emphasis on user experience and deployment simplicity makes it particularly suitable for educational environments.

\subsubsection{Mythic}

Mythic framework, developed by its-a-feature, introduces a microservices architecture that separates C2 functionality into distinct components \cite{mythic2021framework}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Agent-Agnostic Design}: Support for multiple implant types and languages
\item \textbf{Container-Based Architecture}: Each agent type runs in isolated containers
\item \textbf{Web Interface}: Modern React-based user interface
\item \textbf{Collaborative Features}: Multi-operator support with real-time collaboration
\end{itemize}

This architectural approach demonstrates the potential for modular C2 design, though the complexity of deployment and configuration may limit adoption in academic settings.

\subsubsection{Havoc}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Academic and Research Prototypes}
\label{subsec:academic_solutions}

Academic contributions to C2 framework development often focus on specific research questions or novel architectural approaches rather than comprehensive operational capabilities.

\subsubsection{Research-Oriented Frameworks}

Several academic institutions have developed C2 frameworks for research purposes, though few have achieved widespread adoption due to limited documentation and support. Notable examples include university-based projects that explore specific aspects of C2 operations, such as communication protocols, evasion techniques, or detection methodologies.

\section{Architectural Analysis}
\label{sec:architectural_analysis}

\subsection{Communication Architectures}
\label{subsec:communication_architectures}

Contemporary C2 frameworks employ diverse communication architectures, each with distinct advantages and limitations:

\subsubsection{Client-Server Architecture}

The traditional client-server model, exemplified by \cframe{Cobalt Strike} and \cframe{Sliver}, centralizes command distribution and result collection through a dedicated server component. This approach offers several advantages:
